A secure, modern, full-stack application designed to serve as a robust management system for a university. It features a role-based architecture, secure authentication with JWT and OTP verification, and a responsive user interface built with Angular Material.

## Key Features

-   **Secure Authentication**: Full JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication flow.
-   **OTP Verification**: Two-factor account verification during signup for enhanced security.
-   **Role-Based Access Control**: Differentiated dashboards and capabilities for 'Student' and 'Professor' roles.
-   **Reactive Frontend**: Built with Angular and RxJS for a responsive and dynamic user experience.
-   **Modern UI**: Clean and professional user interface using Angular Material components.
-   **RESTful API**: A well-structured backend built with Express.js and Node.js.
-   **Scalable Database**: Uses MongoDB with Mongoose for flexible and powerful data modeling.
-   **Protected Routes**: Angular Route Guards prevent unauthorized access to application sections.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

-   [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) (LTS version recommended)
-   [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli): `npm install -g @angular/cli`
-   A [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register) account (for the free tier database)

## Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up.

### 1. Backend Setup

First, set up the server which will connect to the database.

```bash
# 1. Navigate to the backend directory
cd uni-management-backend

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Create a .env file in the root of the backend folder.
#    Copy the contents of .env.example (or the block below) into it.
touch .env
```

**Fill in your `.env` file with the following variables:**

```env
# Your MongoDB Atlas connection string.
# IMPORTANT: Replace <password> with your actual database user password.
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<your-cluster-url>/uni_management_db?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# A long, random, secret string for signing JWTs.
JWT_SECRET=your-own-very-secret-random-string-12345

# The port the backend server will run on.
PORT=3000
```

> **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT commit your `.env` file to Git. It is included in the `.gitignore`.

### 2. Frontend Setup

Now, set up the Angular client application.

```bash
# 1. Navigate to the frontend directory from the root
cd ../uni-management

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. The frontend is pre-configured to connect to the backend at http://localhost:3000.
#    No further configuration is needed.
```

## Running the Application

You must have both the backend and frontend servers running simultaneously in separate terminal windows.

**1. Run the Backend Server:**

```bash
# In the /uni-management-backend directory
npm start
```

> You should see the output:
> `Backend server is running on http://localhost:3000`
> `Successfully connected to MongoDB Atlas!`

**2. Run the Frontend Server:**

```bash
# In the /uni-management directory
ng serve
```

> Open your browser and navigate to **[http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)**. The application should now be running.

## API Endpoints

The backend exposes the following authentication endpoints under the base path `/api/auth`.

| Method | Endpoint         | Description                                        | Access |
| :----- | :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------- | :----- |
| `POST` | `/register`      | Creates a new user and triggers OTP generation.    | Public |
| `POST` | `/verify-otp`    | Verifies the OTP to activate a user's account.     | Public |
| `POST` | `/login`         | Authenticates a user and returns a JWT.            | Public |

## Future Improvements

-   **Email Service**: Integrate a service like Nodemailer or SendGrid to send actual OTP emails instead of logging to the console.
-   **Expanded Roles**: Add an 'Admin' role with a separate dashboard for managing users and courses.
-   **Profile Management**: Allow users to view and edit their profiles.
-   **Course & Grade Modules**: Build out the core features for managing courses, enrollment, and grades.
-   **Unit & E2E Tests**: Add comprehensive test coverage for both frontend and backend.
